# Contacts-ML
This is a contact application, who uses the note field of the google contact
to store transactions (invoice, payment, ...) with the contact

It can be used as a small "You ow me this" application,
keeping the details (date,reason,amount) 
of the transactions you do with that person

A more thorough application, for full small business admin,
will eventually erupt from this basic code.
